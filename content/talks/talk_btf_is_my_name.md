This talk gives a technical deep dive into what BTF is, how it works and for what it is used.
I gave this talk at the eBPF Vienna meetup.

There is sadly no recording of the talk available.

You can find the spoken text though in my Github [repo](https://github.com/patrickpichler/going-minimal/blob/main/talk.md).
