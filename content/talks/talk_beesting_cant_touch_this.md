This talk tells the story of my research project Beesting.

It starts from how I came up with the idea, over the different iterations that the project went through.

The talk was originally held at CNCF meetup in Linz.

Sadly no recording is available for the talk.

You can find roughly what I said though in my Github [repo](https://github.com/patrickpichler/beesting_talk/blob/main/talk.md).
The source code for Beesting can be found [here](https://github.com/patrickpichler/beesting).
